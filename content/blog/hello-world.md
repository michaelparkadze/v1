Ah, the two words you love to hate as a Dev/Engineer. 😌

So _technically_ this isn’t my first article post, contrary to the order of appearance and description of this particular post. My first post can be found [here](/var-let-and-const-whats-the-difference), which I explain in great detail about the differences between var, let and const.

Anyway, I’m glad you’ve found your way to my personal corner of the internet. Let me introduce myself if I haven't already. My name is Michael, 19 years of age and I’m a software developer from Haifa, Israel. ☀️

I am currently starting a new position of a software developer at new stealth startup and while having some time off in addition to learning new tech and complex topics, I thought I could finally take the time and make myself a lovely website which will also be of use to me to documenting my learning journey and giving me a platform to disscus about topics other than coding of course.

I orginally had ambitions to write about coding, fitness, general life advice and everything else a 19 year-old has on his mind. This is the starting point to all of this. I have thought about a lot of ways to start whether from a plain wordpress site to a hand-coded gorgeous website like this. 😉

After trying out Gatsby and Next, I decided to go with next as it has been a long time since I worked with it and as it turned out, I love using it. 🤩

As I am going through my own journey in life and study a bunch of interesting topics, I hope to at least provide some fun and interesting content. 🤞

If you would like to connect with me and suggest some topics for me to write about, you are more than welcome to send me an [email](mailto:michaelparkadze@icloud.com) or a connection request on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelparkadze/)
